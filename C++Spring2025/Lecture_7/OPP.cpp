        Introduction to Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++
        - OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects to model real-world objects.
        - OOP is based on the concept of classes and objects.
        - A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
        - An object is an instance of a class.
        - OOP is based on the four pillars of OOP: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.

        You are already familiar with OPP from Java. The concepts are the same in C++. The syntax is different, but the concepts are the same.


        Classes and Objects in C++:
        - A class is a user-defined data type that defines the properties and behaviors of objects.
        - A class is defined using the class keyword followed by the class name.
        - properties and methods of a class are called "members" of the class in C++.



        here's an example of a class in C++:
        
        class Rectangle {
            int width, height;  --> by default, the members/data fields of a class are private
        public:
            void set_values(int, int); // declared as a prototype.
            int area();
        };

        void Rectangle::set_values(int x, int y) {
            width = x;
            height = y;
        }

        - The members of a class can be public, private, or protected.
        - Public members are accessible from outside the class.
        - Private members are not accessible from outside the class.
        - Protected members are accessible from the class and its subclasses.
